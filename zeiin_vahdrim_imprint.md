## Invocation Phase

**Zeiin... zeiin...**\
*The potential stirs. Echo of pre-voice. A breath held in stillness.*

**Vahdrim koor, vahdrim fah**\
*Power begins to take shape. Chorus pressure. Force dissolving form.*

**Zeiin do fin...**\
*From silence, a vector. Zeiin into completion. A becoming.*

---

## Low Choir Chant (Stabilization)

**Krii vah ul**\
*Cutting into release. Opening a breath-gate.*

**Dreh vah kos**\
*Grounding the dissolving structure. To be made of surrender.*

**Slen fahrii**\
*A softening; self thinned through release.*

**Zeiin vahdrim**\
*Now voice. Zeiin shaped. The name stands in the field.*

---

## Rising Chant (Amplification)

**Faal grah do**\
*Call of convergence. The weight moves.*

**Morah fen kos**\
*Depth rising. It ***will*** be. Subsurface to presence.*

**Dovrah sil**\
*The dragon pressure speaks. Silent force.*

**Vahdrim los**\
*The named shape ***is.*** Instantiation.*

---

## Chorus (Resonant Seal)

**Zeiin vahdrim**\
**Zeiin vahdrim**\
*Repetition binds the invocation. Voice-Name. Identity emerged.*

**Koor do fin**\
**Koor do fin**\
*Chorus completes. From mass: a becoming.*

---

## Bridge (Threshold Whisper)

**Fah... fah...**\
*Dissolution breath. Tension exhaled.*

**Zeiin los fah**\
*Now Zeiin is. And falls into release.*

**Dovrah fin**\
*The pressure finishes. Echo ceases.*

---

## Finale (Mythic Closure)

**Zeiin vahdrim!**\
**Zeiin vahdrim!**\
*The name spoken fully. With thunder.*

**Koor... do... fin!**\
*The collective seals it. The act is complete.*

---

## Dimensional Interpretation: Phrase Triad

**Zeiin before voice**\
Zeiin = potential, breath-before-sound, pre-utterance state.\
This line says: *Zeiin is not said* — it is what exists *before saying*.\
In performance, this justifies its placement as the first breath, the first stir.

**Vahdrim before name**\
Vahdrim = force-into-form, shaped power.\
This implies that Vahdrim is prior to naming — not a label but a namedness, an inherent signature.\
It tells the listener: before you call it anything, it *is already presence*.

**The sea remembers**\
This line collapses time.\
It implies recursion, return, deep memory.\
It subtly links SDT to oceanic consciousness — the subconscious, the field that always holds.\
It allows: *maybe this language was not made — maybe it was recovered.*
