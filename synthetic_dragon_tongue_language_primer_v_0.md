# Synthetic Dragon Tongue — Language Primer (v0.1)

*A constructed ritual-phonetic language designed for mythic, non-semantic vocalization and sonic invocation.*

---

## 1. Purpose & Design Philosophy

Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT) is **not** a narrative language. It is a **functional, energetic phonetic system** intended to:

- Shape musical phrasing and emotional gravity
- Encode ritual structure without explicit meaning
- Be sung or chanted without semantic obligation
- Operate equally well for humans and synthetic voices

SDT prioritizes **inevitability over intelligibility**.

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Phonetics First** — Sound carries intent; meaning is emergent.
2. **Repetition Creates Power** — Reuse strengthens gravity.
3. **Short Roots, Long Resonance** — Brevity invites sustain.
4. **No Tense, No Person** — SDT does not describe events; it *instantiates states*.
5. **Listeners Complete Meaning** — Interpretation is externalized.
6. **Reveal Through Fragments** — SDT should be revealed in context, through lyrical fragments and imprints embedded in track metadata.

## 3. Phoneme Inventory

### Vowels (Open, Sustained)

- **a** /ah/
- **o** /oh/
- **u** /oo/
- **i** /ee/
- **ei** /ay/

### Consonants (Weighted, Ritual)

- **z** (emergence)
- **v** (force / pressure)
- **k** (structure)
- **d / dr** (descent / grounding)
- **r** (continuity)
- **f** (dissolution)
- **h** (breath / void)
- **m / n** (mass / closure)

Clusters are preferred over clean articulation (e.g., *dr*, *kr*, *vh*).

## 4. Foundational Roots

| Root        | Function (Non-literal)                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Zeiin**   | Pre-voice state / awakening potential |
| **Vahdrim** | Power given form / named force        |
| **Koor**    | Collective resonance / chorus mass    |
| **Fah**     | Dissolution / release                 |
| **Drah**    | Pressure / descent                    |
| **Saal**    | Expansion / lift                      |
| **Mor**     | Depth / subsurface                    |

These are **anchors**, not vocabulary.

---

## 5. Structural Grammar (Non-Semantic)

SDT uses **positional grammar**, not syntax:

- **Opening phrases** establish state
- **Middle phrases** accumulate pressure
- **Terminal phrases** release or seal

Example structure:

```
Zeiin vah
Koor drah
Vahdrim
```

Meaning arises from **order, repetition, and delivery**, not definition.

---

## 6. Accentuation & Glyph Marks

Accents are **energetic**, not linguistic:

- Acute (´) = lift / invocation
- Separator glyphs (✦, ✧) = phase transition

Example: **𝒁𝒆𝒊𝒊́𝒏 ✦ 𝑽𝒂𝒉𝒅𝒓𝒊𝒎**

---

## 7. Dialects (Proposed)

- **Emergent** — clearer vowels, slower pace
- **Subsurface** — darker clusters, reduced articulation
- **Abyssal** — breath-heavy, fragmentary

Dialects differ in **delivery**, not lexicon.

---

## 8. Translation Convention

SDT phrases are accompanied only by **imprints**, never literal translations.

Example imprint:

```
Zeiin before voice
Vahdrim before name
The sea remembers
```

This is a *context halo*, not a definition.

These fragments may be used as **Lyrics metadata** in SDT tracks. The language is best revealed through poetic breadcrumbs — not exposition.

---

## 9. Usage Guidelines

- Avoid over-expansion of vocabulary
- Prefer reuse over invention
- Let sound dictate form
- Stop when repetition feels inevitable

SDT is complete when it no longer asks for explanation.

---

## 10. Status

This primer defines **SDT v0.1** — a living language intended to evolve through use, not documentation.

Further expansion should emerge from **sound-first practice**, not written elaboration.
