3. SUNO STYLE PROMPT (NO JARGON)

Paste this into Style Prompt, not lyrics:

A dark, experimental vocal piece with whispered ritual chanting and cold, emotionless spoken phrases.
Very slow pacing, long instrumental sections, deep drones, no beat, no melody.
Voices alternate between breathy human whispers and flat, robotic speech.
Minimalist, tense, abstract, and unsettling.
The track should feel longer than expected and resist resolution.
