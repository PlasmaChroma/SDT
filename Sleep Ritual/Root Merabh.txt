Version A — Root Merabh (≈4 minutes)

Performance notes
Speak slower than feels necessary.
Every pause is part of the “music.”
Tone: calm, intimate, factual. No “trying.”

Script

Take a breath… and let it be an actual breath.
Not a better breath. Just the one that’s here.
[PAUSE 6s]
Now, feel the weight of your body.
Not as an idea. As gravity.
Feel where you’re being held:
the bed… the couch… the floor… the air itself.
[PAUSE 8s]
The mind may want to do something with this.
You don’t need to.
Right now, we’re not fixing anything.
We’re not improving anything.
We’re letting the system remember: it can be safe in stillness.
[PAUSE 10s]
Bring awareness to the base of the spine.
Root. Foundation. The part of you that knows how to arrive.
No visualization required.
Just notice: there is a place where you meet the Earth.
[PAUSE 10s]
If there’s tension—good.
You don’t have to wrestle it.
You just acknowledge it.
And now, a simple choice:
I allow my body to settle.
I allow the Earth to hold me.
I allow the nervous system to downshift.
[PAUSE 12s]
Let the jaw soften.
Let the tongue rest.
Let the eyes fall back into their own quiet.
[PAUSE 8s]
Now feel the exhale… as permission.
Not effort. Permission.
On the next exhale… let the day slide off you.
Not by force. By gravity.
[PAUSE 12s]
You don’t need to chase sleep.
Sleep is already a function of the body.
Your only part is: stop interfering.
So now—no more reaching.
No more solving.
Only this:
I am here.
And I allow.
[PAUSE 15s]
If thoughts come, they can pass through like wind through trees.
Nothing to argue with.
Nothing to follow.
You are not the thoughts.
You are the one who remains when they pass.
[PAUSE 15s]
And now, you can drift.
The Earth doesn’t require your attention.
It simply holds.
Let the sound carry the rest.
[LONG PAUSE 25–35s] (fade your voice out into the descent)
