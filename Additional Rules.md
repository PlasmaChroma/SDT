# Title naming (Koor restricting)

Here’s a clean restraint system that keeps Koor powerful by making it rare, earned, and structurally meaningful.

Rule 1: Koor is a “chorus event,” not a default

Use Koor only when at least one is true:

Collective / plural voice is central (chant-as-crowd, oath-as-many, assembly energy)

The track contains a formal sealing / declaration moment (a “stamp”)

The arrangement actually behaves like a chorus force (big returns, massed unison, climactic lock-in)

If it’s solo invocation, drift, motion, dread, becoming, weather, dream, etc. — no Koor.

Rule 2: Titles get a “primary root” that’s not Koor

Pick one primary semantic gravity word as the lead, and let Koor appear only as a secondary modifier (or not at all).

Template:
[Primary] [Secondary] [Seal/State]

Examples (structure-only):

Zeiin … (becoming / ignition / emergence)

Thal … (threshold / passage / edge)

Vey / Vahdrim … (vow / depth / binding intent)

Zur … (descent / pull / undercurrent)

Fin … (finality / closure) — carefully, because it’s also a “stamp” word

Then, if needed:

… Koor at the end = “and the many witness it”

Koor … only when it’s explicitly a chorus piece

Rule 3: Two-layer naming solves the “odd shelf look”

Use dual-layer titles so the release page stays varied while SDT remains canonical:

Public title: poetic / English / whatever fits the album aesthetic

SDT Invocation (metadata / subtitle / internal): the ritual name, compact, precise

Example formatting:

Public: Gravitic Lullaby
SDT: Zur Thal :: ᵃ

This keeps SDT “mandatory in the invocation” without turning the public catalog into Koor, Koor, Koor…

Rule 4: When you do use Koor, don’t let it always be prefix

Three placements, each with a different feel:

Suffix Koor → “witnessed by the many”
X Y Koor

Infix Koor → “collective pressure enters midstream”
X Koor Y

Prefix Koor → “chorus-first piece” (rare, ceremonial)
Koor X Y

Rule 5: Use modifier clusters instead of Koor for “weight”

You already have a better hammer than repetition: non-phonetic modifiers (never sung) to encode force/behavior.

:: = pressure/intensity

⟶ = vector / becoming

⟂ = interruption / cut / enforcement

dialect marks like ᵉ ˢ ᵃ = depth/context shading

So instead of Koor as “make it serious,” do:

Zeiin Thal ::

Zur Vahdrim ⟂

Fin Thal ᵃ ::

#  Bracket directive separators
According to a document from January 16, 2026, the most reliable pattern is: use the pipe | to “stack” multiple bracket directives, and reserve commas for lists inside a single directive/value.

Practical rule of thumb (works great for SDT too)

Use | when you’re adding multiple distinct cues in one bracket line (aka “meta tag stacking”):
[..., | ..., | ...]

Use commas when you’re listing items inside one cue (e.g., instruments):
[Instrument: Keys, Drums]

So these are “clean”:

Stacked cues (pipe):
[Chorus | anthemic chorus | stacked harmonies | wide stereo]

Single cue with a list (comma):
[Instrument: Keys, Drums]

Why | is usually better than commas for stacked cues

Community guides explicitly showcase | as the stacking separator inside brackets.

Commas often read like normal punctuation, so they’re more likely to blur into “one long descriptor” instead of multiple directives—whereas | stays legible as a delimiter.

SDT-specific note (your current pattern is aligned)

Your SDT imprint format already uses | to separate section “producer cues,” which is exactly the same idea.

Micro-optimization (when Suno starts “ignoring” tags)

Keep bracket stacks to ~2–4 cues per section header. Once you go “shopping-list mode,” adherence tends to drop.
