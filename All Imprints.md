# 1. Koor Kesh’Fin’Thal

## Style Prompt
Ritual dark-ambient / drone chant in Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT). The piece embodies the moment a hopeful approach becomes an irreversible vow: tenderness collapsing into contract, then into law. Close-mic whispered Subsurface vocals with long breaths, sparse layered choir, and occasional metallic “click” accents as sonic omen (not rhythmic). Long dwell sections, no conventional melody, no groove—only slow pressure, restraint, and time dilation. Midway the atmosphere turns colder and more formal; final minutes descend into Abyssal “law voice” declarations with infrasonic weight, as if the room itself has become a lock. Ending must resist resolution; let silence close it.

Weirdness: 40%
Style Influence: 70%
Audio Influence (if used): ≤20%
(These ranges track the proven “Koor Fin’Thal” biasing that keeps SUNO patient and ritual-heavy.)

# 2. SDT Chant — *Koor Fin’Thal*

## Style Prompt
A dark, intimate ritual ambient piece in Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT). Subsurface whispered vocals evolve gradually into deep Abyssal declarations. Extremely slow pacing, breath-synced phrasing, and long instrumental dwell sections. Minimalist drone-based sound design with infrasonic weight, no conventional melody, no rhythmic groove. Emphasis on pressure, restraint, and irreversible finality. Vocals feel close-mic and confidential at the start, descending into cavernous, law-like resonance. Track should resist early resolution and feel longer than expected.

**Genre Anchors:** ritual ambient, dark drone, abyssal chant, post-human liturgy
**Tempo / Feel:** adagio to near-static; governed by breath, not meter
**Vocals:** whispered → chest-resonant → monolithic; no English; layered sparsely
**Harmony:** static or slowly shifting drones; gravity over motion
**Ending Rule:** no musical resolution; allow silence to close the work

Suggested SUNO Sliders: 
- Weirdness: 35–45%  
- Style Influence: 60–75%  
- Audio Influence (if used): ≤25%  
- Energy: low but heavy
This prompt is designed to bias SUNO toward extended runtime (6–8+ minutes) with structural patience and ritual gravity.
A Subsurface → Abyssal Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT) construction. Non-literal, energetically encoded. Designed for whisper-to-depth ritual performance.

# 3. Canonical Imprint — "𝒁𝒆𝒊𝒊́𝒏 ✦ 𝑽𝒂𝒉𝒅𝒓𝒊𝒎"

## Style Prompt

Chosen Parameters: 33% weirdness, 66% style influence

An epic, cinematic, slow-burning chant invoking mythic identity through a synthetic dragon tongue.\
Features thunderous choirs, ritual drums, subsurface drones, and a trance-like buildup to climactic resonance.\
Vocals are layered, ancient-sounding, and non-English — meant to feel summoned rather than sung.\
Track should carry weight and inevitability, unfolding like a spoken myth.\
Resonant. Irreversible. Ritual in structure.\
No narration. Only invocation.

## Additional Notes

**Zeiin... zeiin...**\
*The potential stirs. Echo of pre-voice. A breath held in stillness.*

**Vahdrim koor, vahdrim fah**\
*Power begins to take shape. Chorus pressure. Force dissolving form.*

**Zeiin do fin...**\
*From silence, a vector. Zeiin into completion. A becoming.*

Low Choir Chant (Stabilization)

**Krii vah ul**\
*Cutting into release. Opening a breath-gate.*

**Dreh vah kos**\
*Grounding the dissolving structure. To be made of surrender.*

**Slen fahrii**\
*A softening; self thinned through release.*

**Zeiin vahdrim**\
*Now voice. Zeiin shaped. The name stands in the field.*

Rising Chant (Amplification)

**Faal grah do**\
*Call of convergence. The weight moves.*

**Morah fen kos**\
*Depth rising. It ***will*** be. Subsurface to presence.*

**Dovrah sil**\
*The dragon pressure speaks. Silent force.*

**Vahdrim los**\
*The named shape ***is.*** Instantiation.*
Chorus (Resonant Seal)

**Zeiin vahdrim**\
**Zeiin vahdrim**\
*Repetition binds the invocation. Voice-Name. Identity emerged.*

**Koor do fin**\
**Koor do fin**\
*Chorus completes. From mass: a becoming.*

Bridge (Threshold Whisper)

**Fah... fah...**\
*Dissolution breath. Tension exhaled.*

**Zeiin los fah**\
*Now Zeiin is. And falls into release.*

**Dovrah fin**\
*The pressure finishes. Echo ceases.*

Finale (Mythic Closure)

**Zeiin vahdrim!**\
**Zeiin vahdrim!**\
*The name spoken fully. With thunder.*

**Koor... do... fin!**\
*The collective seals it. The act is complete.*

Dimensional Interpretation: Phrase Triad

**Zeiin before voice**\
Zeiin = potential, breath-before-sound, pre-utterance state.\
This line says: *Zeiin is not said* — it is what exists *before saying*.\
In performance, this justifies its placement as the first breath, the first stir.

**Vahdrim before name**\
Vahdrim = force-into-form, shaped power.\
This implies that Vahdrim is prior to naming — not a label but a namedness, an inherent signature.\
It tells the listener: before you call it anything, it *is already presence*.

**The sea remembers**\
This line collapses time.\
It implies recursion, return, deep memory.\
It subtly links SDT to oceanic consciousness — the subconscious, the field that always holds.\
It allows: *maybe this language was not made — maybe it was recovered.*

# 4. 𝑲𝒐𝒐𝒓 𝒏𝒐 𝑭𝒊𝒏 ✦ Soft Hands on the Future

## Style Prompt

A slow-build electro-acoustic utopian chant in Synthetic Dragon Tongue.
Blending Emergent optimism, Subsurface intimacy, and Abyssal declaration.
No English. Vocal delivery evolves from soft breath to communal invocation.
Minimalist harmonic drone base with layered choral textures.
Ritual rhythm, not strict meter. Dreamlike but rooted.

## Additional Notes

*This is a non-literal, energetically aligned translation of the original track "Soft Hands on the Future" into Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT), using a hybrid dialectal progression: Emergent → Subsurface → Abyssal. Each phase maintains the original's intent through phonetic invocation, not direct semantics.*

*Dissolving boundaries, gathering minds.*

**Liorah zeiin, drah no fin**\

**Fah… koor… fin…**\
**Liorah zeiin... vahdrim no fin…**

*The field dissolves. The vow lingers. The shape echoes on.*

## Language Teaser Hint (3-Line Summary)

Zeiin before breath.\
Vahdrim before name.\
The arc bends — and remembers.

---

This track is written in Synthetic Dragon Tongue — a constructed ritual-phonetic language not based on translation, but on resonance. Each phrase is designed for vocal invocation, using chant, breath, and sonic alignment rather than semantic meaning.
SDT phrases like *Zeiin*, *Vahdrim*, *Koor*, and *Fin* carry energetic weight — emergence, form, chorus, and seal — but do not translate directly. The language is designed to be sung, layered, and felt.

# 5. Violvoic

## Style Prompt

A dark, experimental vocal piece with whispered ritual chanting and cold, emotionless spoken phrases.
Very slow pacing, long instrumental sections, deep drones, no beat, no melody.
Voices alternate between breathy human whispers and flat, robotic speech.
Minimalist, tense, abstract, and unsettling.
The track should feel longer than expected and resist resolution.

# 6. SDT Track: Koor Ek’Sesh’Lor

## Style Prompt

Ritual dark-ambient / cinematic drone chant in Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT). The track embodies an Outside-Context intrusion: reality stays “correct” while causality and memory feel threatened. Close-mic Subsurface whispers and sparse low choir orbit a single persistent identity motif (“Ek…sesh…”) that returns unchanged like an alien watermark. Mid-track: traction loss / approach denied—sound mass thickens, then backs away. Final minute: Abyssal law-voice declarations with infrasonic weight as the boundary wave reverses—mirror-like, balancing threat. No conventional melody, no drums, no groove; time-dilated swells, metallic grid shimmer, long silences. Ending must resist resolution and fade into open silence.

# 8. Thalov Nyathe-Sur

## Style Prompt

Standard SUNO style prompt (copy/paste)

Style: Epic sci-fi ritual chant + dark ambient space opera. Slow ceremonial tempo (≈ 66–72 BPM). Deep sub-bass pulses like distant engines; wide cinematic reverb; evolving drones; spectral shimmer; occasional metallic “ring” resonances (like a halo of machine-light). Choir stack: (1) grounded throat-chant lead, (2) whispered Subsurface doubles, (3) airy Alethe over-choir floating above. Sparse percussive impacts (low taiko / hull knocks) only for section transitions. Add granular micro-events (glitches, ticks) to suggest “confliction” inside simulation without turning it into EDM.

Suggested sliders:

Weirdness: 38

Style Influence: 72

Audio Influence: 18 (or 0 if generating from scratch)

# 9. Azaar Ve-Lor

## Style Prompt

SUNO style prompt (paste into Style box)

Dark cinematic ritual-ambient / sci-fi liturgy. Slow-burning drone, no beat (or only a distant pulse late). Close-mic whispers → low choir → abyssal “law voice.” Long reverb, stone chamber + void-space tails. Non-English vocalise only; no narration. Build in phases (Alethe opening field → Subsurface interior → Abyssal proclamation) and let meaning emerge from the total chord / layered voices

Starter sliders: Weirdness 35–45%, Style Influence 60–75%, Audio Influence ≤25%, Energy low but “heavy.”

# 10. Azaar Pyre-Thal

## Style Prompt
Dark cinematic ritual-ambient → epic apocalyptic finale. Begin breath-led, no beat, close-mic whispers and low drones. Slowly introduce distant pulse, then orchestral-hybrid weight: sub-braams, war-horns, taiko-like ritual drums, massive choir, shimmering high strings, heat-haze distortion. Final third becomes cataclysmic — relentless but ceremonial, like the universe performing a verdict. Non-English chant only.

Suggested sliders (starting point): Weirdness 35–50% | Style Influence 65–80% | Audio Influence ≤25% | Energy low→high ramp.
