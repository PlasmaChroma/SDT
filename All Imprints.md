SUNO prompt (copy/paste)

Style Prompt:
Ritual dark-ambient / drone chant in Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT). The piece embodies the moment a hopeful approach becomes an irreversible vow: tenderness collapsing into contract, then into law. Close-mic whispered Subsurface vocals with long breaths, sparse layered choir, and occasional metallic “click” accents as sonic omen (not rhythmic). Long dwell sections, no conventional melody, no groove—only slow pressure, restraint, and time dilation. Midway the atmosphere turns colder and more formal; final minutes descend into Abyssal “law voice” declarations with infrasonic weight, as if the room itself has become a lock. Ending must resist resolution; let silence close it.

Suggested SUNO Sliders:

Weirdness: 40%

Style Influence: 70%

Audio Influence (if used): ≤20%
(These ranges track the proven “Koor Fin’Thal” biasing that keeps SUNO patient and ritual-heavy.)

## SUNO — Style Guide Prompt (Master)

**Style Prompt:**  
A dark, intimate ritual ambient piece in Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT). Subsurface whispered vocals evolve gradually into deep Abyssal declarations. Extremely slow pacing, breath-synced phrasing, and long instrumental dwell sections. Minimalist drone-based sound design with infrasonic weight, no conventional melody, no rhythmic groove. Emphasis on pressure, restraint, and irreversible finality. Vocals feel close-mic and confidential at the start, descending into cavernous, law-like resonance. Track should resist early resolution and feel longer than expected.

**Genre Anchors:** ritual ambient, dark drone, abyssal chant, post-human liturgy

**Tempo / Feel:** adagio to near-static; governed by breath, not meter

**Vocals:** whispered → chest-resonant → monolithic; no English; layered sparsely

**Harmony:** static or slowly shifting drones; gravity over motion

**Ending Rule:** no musical resolution; allow silence to close the work

**Suggested SUNO Sliders:**  
- Weirdness: 35–45%  
- Style Influence: 60–75%  
- Audio Influence (if used): ≤25%  
- Energy: low but heavy

*This prompt is designed to bias SUNO toward extended runtime (6–8+ minutes) with structural patience and ritual gravity.*

**Koor... do... fin!**\
*The collective seals it. The act is complete.*

---

## Dimensional Interpretation: Phrase Triad

**Zeiin before voice**\
Zeiin = potential, breath-before-sound, pre-utterance state.\
This line says: *Zeiin is not said* — it is what exists *before saying*.\
In performance, this justifies its placement as the first breath, the first stir.

**Vahdrim before name**\
Vahdrim = force-into-form, shaped power.\
This implies that Vahdrim is prior to naming — not a label but a namedness, an inherent signature.\
It tells the listener: before you call it anything, it *is already presence*.

**The sea remembers**\
This line collapses time.\
It implies recursion, return, deep memory.\
It subtly links SDT to oceanic consciousness — the subconscious, the field that always holds.\
It allows: *maybe this language was not made — maybe it was recovered.*

## SUNO Style Prompt

A slow-build electro-acoustic utopian chant in Synthetic Dragon Tongue.

No English. Vocal delivery evolves from soft breath to communal invocation.
Minimalist harmonic drone base with layered choral textures.
Ritual rhythm, not strict meter. Dreamlike but rooted.

## Language Teaser Hint (3-Line Summary)

Zeiin before breath.\
Vahdrim before name.\
The arc bends — and remembers.

## Lyrics (Copy-Paste Format)

**Lyrics**\
This track is written in Synthetic Dragon Tongue — a constructed ritual-phonetic language not based on translation, but on resonance. Each phrase is designed for vocal invocation, using chant, breath, and sonic alignment rather than semantic meaning.

SDT phrases like *Zeiin*, *Vahdrim*, *Koor*, and *Fin* carry energetic weight — emergence, form, chorus, and seal — but do not translate directly. The language is designed to be sung, layered, and felt.

3. SUNO STYLE PROMPT (NO JARGON)

Paste this into Style Prompt, not lyrics:

A dark, experimental vocal piece with whispered ritual chanting and cold, emotionless spoken phrases.
Very slow pacing, long instrumental sections, deep drones, no beat, no melody.
Voices alternate between breathy human whispers and flat, robotic speech.
Minimalist, tense, abstract, and unsettling.
The track should feel longer than expected and resist resolution.

SUNO style prompt (for this piece)

Ritual dark-ambient / cinematic drone chant in Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT). The track embodies an Outside-Context intrusion: reality stays “correct” while causality and memory feel threatened. Close-mic Subsurface whispers and sparse low choir orbit a single persistent identity motif (“Ek…sesh…”) that returns unchanged like an alien watermark. Mid-track: traction loss / approach denied—sound mass thickens, then backs away. Final minute: Abyssal law-voice declarations with infrasonic weight as the boundary wave reverses—mirror-like, balancing threat. No conventional melody, no drums, no groove; time-dilated swells, metallic grid shimmer, long silences. Ending must resist resolution and fade into open silence.

# Mer-ra Los’Amenti
Ritual cinematic ambient + dark Egyptian/Atlantean mysticism, slow halftime pulse (70–85 BPM), deep sub-bass thumps, huge temple reverb, metallic chimes + sand hiss, low throat-chant choir with occasional ethereal female overtones. Long-form (6–8+ minutes), non-pop structure, gradual build, time-dilation sections, no English vocals.

Standard SUNO style prompt (copy/paste)

Style: Epic sci-fi ritual chant + dark ambient space opera. Slow ceremonial tempo (≈ 66–72 BPM). Deep sub-bass pulses like distant engines; wide cinematic reverb; evolving drones; spectral shimmer; occasional metallic “ring” resonances (like a halo of machine-light). Choir stack: (1) grounded throat-chant lead, (2) whispered Subsurface doubles, (3) airy Alethe over-choir floating above. Sparse percussive impacts (low taiko / hull knocks) only for section transitions. Add granular micro-events (glitches, ticks) to suggest “confliction” inside simulation without turning it into EDM.
