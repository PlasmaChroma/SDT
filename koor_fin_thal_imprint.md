## SUNO — Style Guide Prompt (Master)

**Style Prompt:**  
A dark, intimate ritual ambient piece in Synthetic Dragon Tongue (SDT). Subsurface whispered vocals evolve gradually into deep Abyssal declarations. Extremely slow pacing, breath-synced phrasing, and long instrumental dwell sections. Minimalist drone-based sound design with infrasonic weight, no conventional melody, no rhythmic groove. Emphasis on pressure, restraint, and irreversible finality. Vocals feel close-mic and confidential at the start, descending into cavernous, law-like resonance. Track should resist early resolution and feel longer than expected.

**Genre Anchors:** ritual ambient, dark drone, abyssal chant, post-human liturgy

**Tempo / Feel:** adagio to near-static; governed by breath, not meter

**Vocals:** whispered → chest-resonant → monolithic; no English; layered sparsely

**Harmony:** static or slowly shifting drones; gravity over motion

**Ending Rule:** no musical resolution; allow silence to close the work

**Suggested SUNO Sliders:**  
- Weirdness: 35–45%  
- Style Influence: 60–75%  
- Audio Influence (if used): ≤25%  
- Energy: low but heavy

*This prompt is designed to bias SUNO toward extended runtime (6–8+ minutes) with structural patience and ritual gravity.*
